Project: Converting code from cpp to Go
- Strive for line by line conversion
- Do not change the case of anything
- Retain spacing within each line
- Retain comments
- Always indent 2 spaces
- Never use TABS
- Always keep the same function names and the same case
- Always keep the same variable names and the same case
- Avoid creating new variables
- If a new variable is needed, name it using PascalCase
- Convert any multi-line “flower box” function comment into a single // comment placed directly above the corresponding func line.
- Keep multi-variable var declarations on separate lines (e.g., var x int then var y int), not grouped in a single var (x int, y int) block.
- In consecutive single-line var declarations, pad with spaces so the type columns line up (e.g., var Foo int then var BarBaz string).
- Pattern pDnodeActor->pPlayer->Save()         becomes PlayerSave(pDnodeActor.pPlayer)
- Pattern pDnodeActor->pPlayer->CreatePrompt() becomes CreatePrompt(pDnodeActor.pPlayer)
- Pattern pDnodeActor->pPlayer->GetOutput()    becomes GetOutput(pDnodeActor.pPlayer)
- DO NOT APPLY the changes, just put result in chat window, ready for me to copy
