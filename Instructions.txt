Project: Converting code from cpp to Go
- Strive for line by line conversion
- Do not change the case of anything
- Retain spacing within each line
- Retain comments
- Always indent 2 spaces
- Never use TABS
- Always keep the same function names and the same case
- Always keep the same variable names and the same case
- Avoid creating new variables
- If a new variable is needed, name it using PascalCase
