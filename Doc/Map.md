## Five Philistine cities

Ashdod  
Gath  
Ekron  
Gaza  
Ashkelon  

## Lod

The ancient Lod or Lydda is represented by the modern village of Ludd,
on the road to Jerusalem, about 11 miles Southeast of Yafa. It is a
station on the Jaffa-Jerusalem Railway. It occupies a picturesque hollow
in the plain of Sharon, and is surrounded by gardens and orchards, the
beauty of which intensifies by contrast the squalor of the village. It
was the reputed birthplace of George, and here he is said to have been
buried. The one ruin of importance in the place is that of the church
which perpetuates his name.

The town stood on the great caravan road between Babylon and Egypt, near
its intersection with that from Joppa to Jerusalem and the East. Its
position on these great arteries of commerce meant trade for the
inhabitants. "The manufacture and repair of such requisites for the
journey as sacks, saddles and strappings would create the skilled labor
in cloth, leather, wood and metal that made the neighborhood once the
valley of craftsmen" (Mackie, HDB, under the word). Like many other once
prosperous cities on these and similar caravan routes, Lydda suffered
from diversion of traffic to the sea; and it may be that for none of
them is any great revival now possible.

## Rimmon Rock

Judges 20:47 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto
the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. The rock
Rimmon was doubtless a strong place; but it is uncertain where situated.
It is probable however, that it was near, and took its name from, the
village of Remmon, mentioned by Eusebius, fifteen miles north from
Jerusalem. It appears that rocks are still resorted to in the East, as
places of security; and some of them are even capable of sustaining a
siege.

## Wilderness of Judah

The "wilderness," the sunken district next the [Dead
Sea](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/deadsea.html) (Josh.
15:61), "averaging 10 miles in breadth, a wild,
[barren](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/barren.html),
uninhabitable region, fit only to afford scanty pasturage for sheep and
goats, and a secure home for
[leopards](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/leopard.html),
bears, wild goats, and outlaws" (1 Sam. 17:34; 22:1; Mark 1:13). It was
divided into the "wilderness of En-gedi" (1 Sam. 24:1), the "wilderness
of Judah" (Judg. 1:16; Matt. 3:1), between the Hebron mountain range and
the Dead Sea, the "wilderness of Maon" (1 Sam. 23:24). It contained only
six cities.
