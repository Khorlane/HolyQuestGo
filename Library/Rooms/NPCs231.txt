RoomDesc:
  NPC stands for Non-Player Character. NPCs are people,
animals, insects, anything living. Some of the NPCs are your
enemies and should be vanquished and other NPCs should be
left alone. For example, a rat is fair game, but a guard is
not. To fight a small rat (when manage to you find one), just
type 'kill smallrat'.

  Most NPCs in are your enemies, some will give you
information, others have nothing to say. You should 'hail'
them to see if they will talk to you. To hail a guard, you
would type 'hail guard'.
