RoomDesc:
  A room is more correctly referred to as a place. Now
that place might indeed be a room, like a bedroom. But
it also might be a place, like a town square or city
street or a road or ... well surely you get the idea.

Each time you enter a 'room', you will always see at
least three things: The room name, the room description,
and the room exits. This information can be very
interesting the first time you see it, but after moving
through the same rooms over and over, it becomes much
less interesting as it typically does not change.

For those who think the room descriptions are lacking in
some way, please volunteer to rewrite them.
