RoomName:     Ravine Bottom
RoomDesc:
  You cannot see the sky, the ravine has become like a
tunnel. The walls tower above your head and arch toward
each other, blocking your view of the sky. A light breeze
can be felt coming from the southeast. Sounds of running
water can be heard coming from the southwest.
