RoomDesc:
  The Kidron brook flows through this valley, but
only in the winter. It is just a dry bed during the
summer. A dusty road heads off to the southwest.

To the south, the valley plunges down among the bare
terraces, precipices, and crags of the wilderness of
Judea, the wilderness of the scapegoat. So barren and
blistered, so furnace-like does the valley become as
it drops below the level of the sea, that it takes the
name of Wady-en-Nar or the Fire Wady.
