RoomDesc:
  Items are sometimes referred to as objects. Some
examples of items are: sword, apple, waterskin,
training tunic, etc. You acquire items by defeating
your enemies, buying them from a shopkeeper, or another
warrior may give you an item. Items can be divided into
categories such as food, drink, armor, and weapons.

All items have one or more names. For example a pair of
goatskin gloves has the following names: 'goat', 'skin',
'goatskin', 'gloves', and 'goatskingloves'. So if you
are buying gloves and the vendor has leather gloves and
goatskingloves for sell and you type 'buy gloves', you
will get the first gloves in the vendor's list of items.
To ensure you get the item you really want, use the full
name, like 'buy goatskingloves'.
