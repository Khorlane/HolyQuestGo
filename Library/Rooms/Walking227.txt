RoomDesc:
  Very good, you can walk. The exits for this room
are east and west. You may continue your training
by using any of the following commands to move east:

e
east
go east

  The last form of the move command 'go <exit>' is used
when an exit is not a compass direction. For example, if a
room had an exit called ArmorShop, to get to the Armor Shop
you would use the command 'go armorshop'. You can't use that
command in this room because there is no exit labeled
ArmorShop. But, as you explore Jerusalem you may discover a
room with an exit that is labeled ArmorShop and you will know
how to enter the shop.
