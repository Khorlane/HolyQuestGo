RoomDesc:
  The trail ascends to a dry, windswept plateau that is
dotted with sprigs of grass. Wild goats can be found here
foraging for food. Animals that like to eat goats are found
here too. Continuing up to the plateau requires careful
climbing as the trail becomes a series of rock ledges.
