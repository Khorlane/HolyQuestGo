RoomDesc:
  Welcome to king David's mighty warrior training. You
are wise to elist the help of the royal trainers as
you begin developing the skills needed to defend the
kingdom.

  Let's start at the beginning. As with all new recruits,
you will first need to learn walk and talk. Ah, now you
may believe that you already know how to walk and talk,
but just hang on a minute or two and maybe you will
learn something.

  Ok, walk east by typing 'e'.
