RoomDesc:
  This land doesn't recieve much rainfall and the ground is
composed primarily of infertile Senonian Chalk. During the
winter months, the wilderness usually has a light covering
of green grass.

  This is a wild, barren, uninhabitable region, fit only to
afford scanty pasturage for sheep and goats, and a secure
home for leopards, bears, wild goats, and outlaws.
