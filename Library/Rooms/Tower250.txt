RoomDesc:
  You are inside the stone tower that is used to protect
the vineyard. It also provides a place for the owner and
their family to stay during the summer while the grapes
are being picked. Doorways lead out into the vineyard in
all directions. A ladder leads up through a small hole
above your head.
